    <dd>Casualty, stylised as CASUAL+Y, is a British medical drama television series that airs weekly on BBC One, and the longest-running emergency medical drama television series in the world. Created by Jeremy Brock and Paul Unwin, it was first broadcast on 6 September 1986, and transmitted in the UK on BBC One. The original producer was Geraint Morris.

The programme is based around the fictional Holby City Hospital and focuses on the staff and patients of the hospital&#39;s Accident and Emergency Department. The show has very few ties to its sister programme Holby City which began as a spin off from Casualty in 1999 and is set in the same hospital, but upstairs. The show&#39;s plots and characters occasionally crossover between the two programmes, but this is rare, and each show can easily be followed without having to watch the other. Casualty is shown weekly on a Saturday evening, which has been its time slot since the early 1990s.</dd>

    <dd>Goede tijden, slechte tijden, also known as GTST, is the longest-running Dutch soap opera, which began on 1 October 1990 on RTL4. The programme was the first daily soap in the Netherlands. The soap is produced by Joop van den Ende and to date over 4,000 episodes have been broadcast. It was inspired by the Australian soap The Restless Years, although it started following its own course during the third season. GTST is broadcast Monday to Friday at 20:00. Around 1.5 million viewers watch each episode. It is the highest rated soap opera in the Netherlands.

The soap mainly revolves around the lives of the families Alberts, Sanders, De Jong, Van Houten and Bouwhuis. It all takes place in the fictional town of Meerdijk. Like any other soap, marriage, divorce, kidnapping and business are a few of the ingredients of GTST, although in recent years, GTST has become known for writing and producing more controversial storylines. GTST is also known for having a summer break each year, ending a season sometime in June with a cliffhanger, only to resume three months later in September. Although the early cliffhangers often revolved around family drama, later cliffhangers have often revolved around disasters and unexpected twists.</dd>

    <dd>Judge Judy is an American arbitration-based reality court show presided over by retired Manhattan Family Court Judge Judith Sheindlin. The show features Sheindlin adjudicating real-life small claims disputes within a simulated courtroom set. All parties involved must sign contracts, agreeing to arbitration under Sheindlin. The series is in first-run syndication and distributed by CBS Television Distribution.

Judge Judy, which premiered on September 16, 1996, reportedly revitalized the court show genre. Only two other arbitration-based reality court shows preceded it, The People&#39;s Court and Jones and Jury. Sheindlin has been credited with introducing the &quot;tough&quot; adjudicating approach into the judicial genre, which has led to several imitators. The two court shows that outnumber Judge Judy&#39;s seasons, The People&#39;s Court and Divorce Court, have both lasted via multiple lives of production and shifting arbiters, making Sheindlin&#39;s span as a television arbiter the longest.

By 2011, Judge Judy had been nominated 14 consecutive years for Daytime Emmy Awards without ever winning. On June 14, 2013, however, Judge Judy won its first Daytime Emmy for Outstanding Legal/Courtroom Program on its 15th nomination. It is the first long-running, highly-rated court show to win an Emmy.</dd>

    <dd>Strictly Come Dancing: It Takes Two, or simply Strictly: It Takes Two, is a British television programme, the companion show to the popular BBC One programme Strictly Come Dancing. It airs on weeknights during the run of the main show on BBC Two at 6:30pm. Claudia Winkleman was the first presenter of the series; however due to her pregnancy in 2011 she had to leave and since then former Strictly finalist Zoë Ball has presented it.

Before 2010, BBC Two Scotland did not broadcast the show on Thursdays, when locally-produced Gaelic language programming aired in the slot instead, though during the 2008 and 2009 series the Thursday night show was carried as an alternative digital stream via BBC Red Button.

The programme features interviews and training footage of the couples competing in the main Saturday night show, opinions from the judges on the previous Saturday show and the training footage for the next, and interviews with celebrities who have been watching the show. Head judge Len Goodman had a weekly spot with Claudia Winkleman entitled &quot;Len&#39;s Masterclass&quot;, in which he demonstrated the dances to be performed on the following Saturday - this has been discontinued since Zoe Ball took over the presenter role.</dd>

The brothers became fascinated with the island after reading the January, 1965 issue of Reader&#39;s Digest magazine which featured an article on the Restall family&#39;s work to solve the mystery of the so-called &quot;Money Pit.&quot;

No one knows what&#39;s buried at Oak Island. Theories range from pirate treasure to Shakespeare&#39;s Lost Folios to a priceless religious artifact brought over by the Knights Templar. The myths of the island have proven irresistible to many, including historical figures like John Wayne, Errol Flynn and Franklin D. Roosevelt, who all financed or took part in digs in what&#39;s become one of the longest treasure hunts in history.</dd>

    <dd>The League of Gentlemen is a quartet of British dark comedy writers/performers, formed in 1995 by Jeremy Dyson, Mark Gatiss, Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith. The television programme for which they are best known, although officially labelled a sitcom, was initially more sketch-based, linked together by their common setting: the fictional village of Royston Vasey, based on the town of Alston, Cumbria and set somewhere in the north of England. The show contains elements of horror. The first series aired on BBC Two in 1999, and follows the lives of dozens of the town&#39;s bizarre inhabitants, played by Gatiss, Pemberton and Shearsmith in a number of different guises and make-up. The television series was filmed mainly in Hadfield, but also features Glossop, Gamesley, Marsden, Mottram, Hope Valley, and Todmorden.

The series ended in 2002 although a movie version of the show was released in 2005. Rumours have circulated since 2007 that the show would return for a full length series or special but nothing has ever been confirmed or denied. However, Shearsmith and Pemberton did reunite in 2009 to create a similarly dark BBC sitcom, Psychoville, which featured an episode guest-starring Gatiss. The three reunited again in 2012 to film a series of sketches for the fourth series of CBBC show Horrible Histories.</dd>

It previously aired for fourteen seasons on Spike TV. The show features professional MMA fighters living together in Las Vegas, Nevada, and follows them as they train and compete against each other for a prized contract with the UFC. The series debuted on January 17, 2006, with its first episode, &quot;The Quest Begins&quot;. To date, there have been twenty seasons of the show, two per calendar year. Each season features either one or two weight classes in the tournament.

The historic Forrest Griffin vs. Stephan Bonnar fight in the first season drew millions of viewers to the show and launched the sport into the mainstream. Because of this success, The Ultimate Fighter was regarded as instrumental to the survival and expansion of the UFC and mixed martial arts into the mainstream. Many current and past UFC fighters are alumni of the show, with some competitors going on to become coaches in future seasons. The show has undergone multiple format changes since its inception, including the introduction of the wildcard bout. Many winners have gone on to compete for UFC championships with some becoming UFC champions.</dd>

    <dd>The Unknown War is an American documentary television series. The 20-part series documents the World War II conflict between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. Each episode is about 48 minutes long, similar in format to The World at War. The footage was edited from over 3.5 million feet of film taken by Soviet camera crews from the first day of the war, 22 June 1941, to the Soviet entry into Berlin in May 1945. Most of these films have never been seen outside this documentary series.

The series is hosted by Academy Award Winner Burt Lancaster, who spent three weeks in eight cities in the USSR for location filming. Film footage from Soviet archives comprises a major portion of the series, supplemented by film from both the United States and British archives. Appearing in exclusive interviews would be Russian Commanders like Georgi Zhukov and Vasily Chuikov.

The series was produced with Soviet cooperation after the release of The World at War, which the Soviet government felt paid insufficient attention to their part in World War II. Released in 1978, The Unknown War is sympathetic to the Soviet struggle against Nazi Germany. It was quickly withdrawn from TV airings after it ran in 1978, possibly because its tone was at odds with the growing tensions between East and West after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Later it returned to airings on cable, including A&amp;E, the History Channel and YouTube.</dd>

    <dd>The X Factor is a British television music competition to find new singing talent, contested by aspiring singers drawn from public auditions. Created by Simon Cowell, the show began in September 2004 and has since aired annually from August/September through to December. The show is produced by FremantleMedia&#39;s Thames and Cowell&#39;s production company SYCOtv. It is broadcast on the ITV network in the United Kingdom and TV3 in Ireland, with spin-off behind-the-scenes show The Xtra Factor screened on ITV2. It is the originator of the international The X Factor franchise. The X Factor was devised as a replacement for the highly successful Pop Idol, which was put on indefinite hiatus after its second series, largely because Cowell, who was a judge on Pop Idol, wished to launch a show to which he owned the television rights. The perceived similarity between the two shows later became the subject of a legal dispute. The &quot;X Factor&quot; of the title refers to the undefinable &quot;something&quot; that makes for star quality.

The original judging panel was Cowell, Sharon Osbourne and Louis Walsh. Dannii Minogue joined the panel in series 4, and Cheryl Cole replaced Osbourne in series 5 after her departure. After series 7, Cowell and Cole both left to judge the American version of the show whilst Minogue left the show due to commitments on Australia&#39;s Got Talent. Kelly Rowland, Tulisa Contostavlos and Gary Barlow then joined Walsh on the judging panel for series 8, though Rowland announced she would not return for series 9 and was replaced by Nicole Scherzinger. Osbourne later returned in 2013, replacing Contostavlos. Since 2007, the show has been presented by Dermot O&#39;Leary, who replaced original host Kate Thornton. The show is split into a series of phases, following the contestants from auditions through to the grand finale. In the original televised audition phase of the show, contestants sang in an audition room in front of just the judges. From series 6 onwards, auditionees sing on a stage in front of the judges and a live audience. Successful auditionees go through to &quot;bootcamp&quot; and then to &quot;judges&#39; houses&quot;, where judges narrow down the acts in their category down to three or four acts to mentor for the live shows, where the public vote for their favourite acts following weekly live performances by the contestants.</dd>

    <dd>This Hour Has 22 Minutes is a weekly Canadian television comedy that airs on CBC Television. Launched in 1993 during Canada&#39;s 35th general election, the show focuses on Canadian politics, combining news parody, sketch comedy and satirical editorials. Originally featuring Cathy Jones, Rick Mercer, Greg Thomey and Mary Walsh, the series featured satirical sketches of the weekly news and Canadian political events. The show&#39;s format is a mock news program, intercut with comic sketches, parody commercials and humorous interviews of public figures. The on-location segments are frequently filmed with slanted camera angles.

Its full name is a parody of This Hour Has Seven Days, a CBC newsmagazine from the 1960s; the &quot;22 Minutes&quot; refers to the fact that a half-hour television program in Canada and the U.S. is typically 22 minutes long with eight minutes of commercials.

Jones and Walsh had previously worked together on the sketch comedy series CODCO, on which Thomey sometimes appeared as a guest. Mercer had been a notable young writer and performer on his own, touring several successful one-man shows of comedic political commentary.</dd>

    <dd>Transporter: The Series is an English-language French-Canadian action-adventure television series, spun off from the Transporter film series created by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen. It is co-produced by the French Atlantique Productions and the Canadian boutique entertainment company QVF Inc. in association with broadcast partners M6, RTL, The Movie Network, Movie Central and HBO/Cinemax.

The series follows the events and concept of the film trilogy, continuing adventures of Frank Martin, a professional freelance courier driver for hire who will deliver anything, anywhere – no questions asked – for the right price, and lives by three &quot;unbreakable&quot; rules, which he constantly breaks. Chris Vance takes over the role of Frank from Jason Statham and is joined by Andrea Osvárt, who plays the leading female role in the series, starring as a former CIA agent and love interest for Frank, who organizes his missions, and François Berléand, the only returning actor from the film series, who reprises his role as Inspector Tarconi.

Twelve episodes were ordered for 2012 with an overall budget of $40,000,000, or €30.000.000. The show premiered that year on October 11 in Germany on RTL, and on December 6 in France on M6. The Canadian premiere was on January 4, 2013 on HBO Canada and Super Écran 1. The broadcast started in India on 25th January 2013 on Sony PIX channel.</dd>

    <dd>Young Justice is an Emmy Award winning American animated television series created by Brandon Vietti and Greg Weisman for Cartoon Network. Despite its title, it is not a direct adaptation of Peter David, Todd Dezago and Todd Nauck&#39;s Young Justice comic series, but rather an adaptation of the entire DC Universe with a focus on young superheroes. The series follows the lives of teenaged heroes and sidekicks who are members of a fictional covert operation group called The Team. The Team is essentially a young counterpart to the famous adult team, the Justice League. The main setting is the fictional universe of Earth-16, during a time period in which superheroes are a relatively recent phenomenon. The series debuted with an hour long special on November 26, 2010 with the airing of the first two episodes, &quot;Independence Day&quot; and &quot;Fireworks&quot;. Young Justice premiered on September 9, 2011 on Teletoon, in Canada. The series ended alongside fellow DC Nation show Green Lantern: The Animated Series after its second season came to a conclusion during spring 2013. Because of this, their slots will be taken by new shows Beware the Batman and Teen Titans Go!, respectively.</dd>

    <dd>1940 год. Укрывающийся в Мексике политический эмигрант Лев Троцкий, потеряв за одиннадцать лет изгнания всех близких, понимает: Сталин будет преследовать его до конца дней. Троцкий остается, чтобы дать бой. Но его оружием станут не пули, а слова. Он оставит политическое завещание, впервые искренне рассказав о том, как бедный еврейский юноша стал пророком нового мира и разрушил крупнейшую империю.</dd>

    <dd>איילת זורר היא יעל, מנתחת בכירה ומוערכת שניצבת מול דילמה גורלית ומוסרית: החוטפים דורשים ממנה להרוג את ראש הממשלה על שולחן הניתוחים בתמורה לחיי ילדיה ובעלה. יאיר לוטן מגלם את דמותו של אדם רובין, קצין ימ&quot;מ מצטיין שנסיבות טראגיות מובילות אותו לעמוד בראש קבוצת שכירי חרב שמטרתם להרוג את ראש הממשלה. הזמן שבני הבית והחוטפים מבלים יחד בבית הופך למסע הכרות מחדש של בני המשפחה אחד עם השני – המסכות יורדות, סודות מן העבר נחשפים, מערכות יחסים מתפרקות וסימני שאלה רבים מופיעים.</dd>
